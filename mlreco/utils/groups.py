# utility function to reconcile groups data with energy deposition and 5-types data:
# problem: parse_cluster3d and parse_sparse3d will not output voxels in same order
# additionally, some voxels in groups data do not deposit energy, so do not appear in images
# also, some voxels have more than one group.
# plan is to put in a function to:
# 1) lexicographically sort group data (images are lexicographically sorted)
# 2) remove voxels from group data that are not in image
# 3) choose only one group per voxel (by lexicographic order)
# WARNING: (3) is certainly not a canonical choice
